**Hi there 👋**

## I'm Bryan Stanski

### 🎉About Me 🎉
- 🎓I’m currently working on my computer science degree at Raritan Valley Community College.
- 🎺I play the trumpet and occasionally the french horn.
  - Most Recent Recorded Performance Here --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ALAqbTlxP8

- 🥁I am also a big DCI (Drum Corps International) Fan. Some of my favorite Corps include:
  - The Cadets, Bluecoats, Boston Crusaders, Blue Devils, Carolina Crown, Spirit of Atlanta, and the Santa Clara Vanguard
- 🛹One of my favorite hobbies is longboarding around the towns nearby.
- 🕹Another is playing a variety of video games. My main ones include League of Legends, any main series Pokemon game, Maplestory, Civ 6 and Humankind.
  - While those are all PC games, I do also play both Pokemon Go and Pikmin Bloom to help get me out of the house and moving a lot more. Because of them, every week I end up walking about 10k steps on average per a day.
- Going along with that, I have also been dabbling in creating custom huds for League of Legends where I even posted a few @ https://killerskins.com/maglengg/ (Sadly I have not had the time to keep up with all the file updates Riot has put out so all of mine are out of date, but I hope to have the time to come back and update them + make more in a few months) 
  - Here are 2 examples
