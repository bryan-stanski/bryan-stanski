- ü•ÅI am also a big DCI (Drum Corps International) Fan. Some of my favorite Corps include:
  - The Cadets, Bluecoats, Boston Crusaders, Blue Devils, Carolina Crown, Spirit of Atlanta, and the Santa Clara Vanguard
- üõπOne of my favorite hobbies is longboarding around the towns nearby.
- üïπAnother is playing a variety of video games. My main ones include League of Legends, any main series Pokemon game, Maplestory, Civ 6 and Humankind.
  - While those are all PC games, I do also play both Pokemon Go and Monster Hunter Now to help get me out of the house and moving a lot more.
- Going along with that, I have also been dabbling in creating custom huds for League of Legends where I even posted a few on [RuneForge](https://www.runeforge.io/profile/maglen/profile) (Sadly with Riot's Vanguard coming to League soon, there is a high likelihood custom huds won't be usable anymore, so I only have my most popular one uploaded until we get confirmation on whether or not they will be usable)
  - Here are 2 examples
